# Question
What is Event Driven Architecture?

# Answer
Lets imagine we have 10 people working in a room. Everytime one of the workers does something cool, they shout out "Hey I did something cool!" and another worker hears that and responds "Hey that is pretty cool! Check this out!"

This is pretty much an Event Driven Architecture or EDA. When one task is done, it may trigger other tasks to complete theirs as well. This makes it so that our computer isn't constantly running different things all at once, only when their specified event is called.
